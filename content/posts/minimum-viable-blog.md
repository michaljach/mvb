title: Minimum Viable Blog (MVB) idea
tags: post
---

Inspired by [Manuel Moreale blog post](https://manuelmoreale.com/minimum-viable-blog) I created this simple and minimal blog engine based on Markdown. It's a GitHub repository template which you can copy, create and host your MVB Blog for free in seconds. Since it's Markdown you can write posts, create pages using only GitHub online editor.
